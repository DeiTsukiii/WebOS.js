# WebOS.js

An interactive web-based virtual Unix-like "operating system".

## üìå About

WebOS.js is a minimalist yet interactive simulated "operating system", built entirely in JavaScript, designed to run directly in your web browser. It provides a command-line interface (shell) experience, allowing users to interact with a persistent virtual file system. The project aims to recreate the feel and basic functionalities of a Linux terminal environment, enabling users to explore a file structure, manipulate data, and execute basics commands.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * **Virtual File System**: A comprehensive directory hierarchy (`/`, `/bin`, `/home`, `/etc`, etc.) that persists locally in the browser's storage.
  * **Command Line Interface (Shell)**: A functional terminal where you can type and execute commands as if on a real Unix-like system.
  * **Essential Commands**: Implementations of classic Unix commands such as `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `cp`, `rm`, `mv`, `pwd`, `echo`, `clear`, `help`, etc.
  * **Error Handling**: Clear and specific error messages to guide the user through invalid input or unauthorized operations.
  * **Data Persistence**: All modifications to the virtual file system are automatically saved via your browser's local storage, ensuring your work persists between sessions.
